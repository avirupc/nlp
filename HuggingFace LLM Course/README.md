# Hugging Face LLM Course 🤗

This repository is for tracking my progress through the Hugging Face LLM course, aimed at gaining a foundational understanding of LLMs and NLP.

I’ll organize the materials, notes, and code scripts chapter-wise. The main source material can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter1/1).

The course provides Google Colab Notebooks with code examples. I will save these notebooks in this repo, chapter-wise, and run my experiments directly on them.

Wish me luck! 🤞
