# NLP Projects Repository

This is something new for me - **Natural Language Processing** or **NLP**! 

This repository contains my  NLP learning projects.  
Each week has its own folder with Jupyter notebooks, README, and related resources.

## Folder Structure


- **WeekX/** → contains notebooks and notes for the week
- **requirements.txt** → list of Python packages to recreate the environment
- **.vscode/** → VS Code settings (optional)
- **nlp/** → **not included** in GitHub (virtual environment)

## Project Setup

### 1. Python Virtual Environment

Create a dedicated Python virtual environment called `nlp` for this repository:

```bash
python -m venv nlp
```
As I am using Windows:

```bash
nlp\Scripts\activate
```
(to be continued)
