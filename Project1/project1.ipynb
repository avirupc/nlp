    "### 🧾 **Understanding TF-IDF Vectorization**\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, machine learning models can’t work directly with raw text — they need **numerical features**.\n",
    "One of the most common ways to convert text into numbers is **TF-IDF**, which stands for: **Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency**\n",
    "\n",
    "It measures **how important a word (or phrase)** is to a document in a collection of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how it works conceptually:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Term Frequency (TF):**\n",
    "  How often a word appears in a given document.\n",
    "  For example, if “movie” appears 3 times in a 100-word review, its TF = 3/100 = 0.03.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):**\n",
    "  How *unique* that word is across all documents.\n",
    "  Common words like “the” or “is” appear in almost every review, so their IDF is low.\n",
    "  Rare, meaningful words like “masterpiece” or “boring” appear in fewer reviews, so their IDF is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **TF-IDF score** for each word = TF × IDF.\n",
    "This way, we get higher scores for words that are *frequent in a specific review* but *rare across the entire dataset* — great for detecting sentiment-bearing words.\n",

    "\n",
    "To move toward **semantic understanding**, we use **Word2Vec**, a neural-network-based model that represents each word as a **dense numerical vector** in a high-dimensional space.\n",
    "Words with **similar meanings** end up having **similar vectors** — e.g.,\n",

    "1. **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Predicts a word based on its surrounding context words.\n",
    "   * Example: given “*the movie was [*__*]*”, it predicts “great”.\n",
    "   * Works well for large datasets and frequent words.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Skip-Gram:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Does the opposite — predicts *context words* given a *target word*.\n",
    "   * Example: given the word “great”, it tries to predict nearby words like “movie”, “was”.\n",
    "   * Performs better for smaller datasets and captures rare-word representations more effectively.\n",
